# Calculate Adsorption Energy

To calculate the adsorption energy, use the following formula:

E_abs = E_total - (E_surface + E_adsorbant)

1. Check the Python script.

2. Utilize the Python script to generate the system (adsorbant: H2O).

3. Set up Quantum Espresso input files and execute geometry optimization for three systems.

4. Employ the aforementioned formula to compute the adsorption energy.

5. Repeat the aforementioned procedure for a new molecule (you decide the adsorbant).
